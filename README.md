FoodWander
==========
This is a simple web application that allows users to search for recipes based on the ingredients they have at home. The application uses the Spoonacular API to search for recipes based on the ingredients the user inputs. The user can also save recipes to their profile and view them later. The application is built using the Flask framework and uses a SQLite database to store user information and saved recipes.
